  <h2 class='c004'>AN ACCOUNT, &amp;C.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>On Thursday, the 30th of May last, about 3 o’clock
in the afternoon, the Intendant of Charleston was informed
by a gentleman of great respectability, (who,
that morning, had returned from the country) that a
favourite and confidential slave of his had communicated
to him, on his arrival in town, a conversation
which had taken place at the market on the Saturday
preceding, between himself and a black man; which
afforded strong reasons for believing that a revolt and
insurrection were in contemplation among a proportion
at least of our black population. The Corporation
was forthwith summoned to meet at 5 o’clock, for the
purpose of hearing the narrative of the slave who had
given this information to his master, to which meeting
the attendance of His Excellency the Governor was solicited;
with which invitation he promptly complied.
Between, however, the hours of 3 and 5 o’clock, the
gentleman who had conveyed the information to the
Intendant, having again examined his slave, was induced
to believe, that the negro fellow who had communicated
the intelligence of the intended revolt to the
slave in question, belonged to Messrs. J. &amp;. D. Paul,
Broad Street, and resided in their premises. Accordingly,
with a promptitude worthy of all praise, without
waiting for the interposition of the civil authority
he applied to the Messrs. Paul and had the whole of
their male servants committed to the Guard-House,
until the individual who had accosted the slave of
this gentleman, on the occasion previously mentioned,
could be identified from among them.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>On the assembling of the Corporation at five, the
slave of this gentleman was brought before them,
having previously identified Mr. Paul’s William as the
man who had accosted him in the market, he then
related the following circumstances:</p>

<p class='c005'>‘On Saturday afternoon last (my master being out
of town) I went to market; after finishing my business
I strolled down the wharf below the fish market,
from which I observed a small vessel in the stream
with a singular flag; whilst looking at this object,
a black man, (Mr. Paul’s William) came up to me
and remarking the subject which engaged my attention
said, I have often seen a flag with the number 76
on it, but never with 96, before. After some trifling
conversation on this point, he remarked with considerable
earnestness to me. Do you know that something
serious is about to take place? To which I
replied no. Well, said he, there is, and many of us
are determined to right ourselves! I asked him to
explain himself—when he remarked, why, we are
determined to shake off our bondage, and for this
purpose we stand on a good foundation, many have
joined, and if you will go with me, I will show you
the man, who has the list of names who will take
yours down.—I was so much astonished and horror
struck at this information, that it was a moment or
two before I could collect myself sufficiently to tell
him I would have nothing to do with this business,
that I was satisfied with my condition, that I was
grateful to my master for his kindness and wished
no change.—I left him instantly, lest, if this fellow
afterwards got into trouble, and I had been seen
conversing with him, in so public a place, I might be
suspected and thrown into difficulty.—I did not however
remain easy under the burden of such a secret,
and consequently determined to consult a free man of
colour named —— and to ask his advice. On conferring
with this friend, he urged me with great earnestness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>to communicate what had passed between
Mr. Paul’s man and myself to my master, and not to
lose a moment in so doing.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> I took his advice, and
not waiting, even for the return of my master to town,
I mentioned it to my mistress and young master.—On
the arrival of my master, he examined me as to
what had passed, and I stated to him what I have
mentioned to yourselves.’</p>

<p class='c005'>On this witness being dismissed from the presence of
Council, the prisoner (William) was examined. The
mode resorted to in his examination was to afford him
no intimation of the subject of the information which
had been lodged against him, as it was extremely desirable
in the first place, to have the testimony of the
other witness corroborated as to time and place, that,
from the confessions of the prisoner himself, it might
appear that he was at the fish-market at the period
stated, and that a singular flag, flying on board of a
schooner, had formed the subject of his observation.
After a vast deal of equivocation, he admitted all
these facts, but when the rest of his conversation
was put home to him, he flatly denied it, but with
so many obvious indications of guilt, that it was deemed
unwise to discharge him. He was remanded, for
the night, to the Guard-House, it having been decided
to subject him to solitary confinement in the black-hole
of the Work-House, where, on the succeeding morning,
he was to be conveyed.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the morning of the 31st he was again examined
by the attending Warden at the Guard-House (having,
during the night, made some disclosures to Capt. Dove)
on which occasion he admitted all the conversation
which he had held at the fish-market, with the witness
before mentioned, and stated that he had received
his information from Mingo Harth, who was in
possession of the muster-roll of the insurgents.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>With the hope of still further disclosures William
was conveyed to the Work-House and placed in solitary
confinement. The individuals (Mingo Harth and
Peter Poyas) against whom he gave information, as
those who had communicated to him the intelligence
of the plot for raising an insurrection, were forthwith
taken up by the Wardens and their trunks examined.
These fellows behaved with so much composure and
coolness, and treated the charge, alleged against them,
with so much levity—(no writings being found in their
chests, containing the smallest suspicion, excepting an
enigmatical letter,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a> which was then too obscure for explanation,
and to which subsequent events only afforded
a clue)—that the Wardens (Messrs. Wesner &amp; Condy)
were completely deceived, and had these men discharged.
One of these (Peter Poyas) proved afterwards, as
will appear in the sequel, to be one of the principal
ringleaders in the conspiracy, on whose courage and
sagacity great reliance was placed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Council being still under the conviction that William
Paul was in possession of more information than he
had thought proper to disclose, a Committee was appointed
to examine him from time to time, with the
hope of obtaining further intelligence. Although Peter
and Mingo had been discharged, yet it was deemed
advisable to have them watched, and consequently
spies were employed of their own colour for this purpose,
in such a manner as to give advices of all their
movements.</p>

<p class='c005'>Things remained in this state for six or seven days,
until about the 8th of June, when William, who had
been a week in solitary confinement, beginning to
fear that he would soon be led forth to the scaffold, for
summary execution, in an interview with Mr. Napier,
(one of the Committee appointed to examine him) confessed,
that he had for some time known of the plot,
that it was very extensive, embracing an indiscriminate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>massacre of the whites, and that the blacks were to be
headed by an individual, who carried about him a charm
which rendered him invulnerable. He stated, that the
period fixed for the rising, was on the second Sunday in
June. This information was without delay conveyed
to his Excellency the Governor, and Council forthwith
convened. Whatever faith we might have been disposed
to place in the unsupported and equivocal testimony
of William, it was not conceived to be a case in
which our doubts should influence our efforts for preparation
and defence. Measures were consequently
promptly taken, to place the City Guard in a state of
the utmost efficiency. Sixteen hundred rounds of ball
cartridges were provided, and the centinels and patrols
ordered on duty with loaded arms. Such had been our
fancied security, that the guard had previously gone on
duty without muskets, with sheathed bayonets and
bludgeons.</p>

<p class='c005'>Three or four days now elapsed, and notwithstanding
all our efforts, we could obtain no confirmation of
the disclosures of William, on the contrary, they seemed
to have sustained some invalidation, from the circumstance,
of one of the individuals (Ned Bennett)
whom he named as a person who had information in
relation to the insurrection, coming voluntarily to the
Intendant, and soliciting an examination, if he was an
object of suspicion. In this stage of the business, it
was not deemed advisable prematurely to press these
examinations, as it might have a tendency to arrest
any further developments.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the night, however, of Friday the 14th, the information
of William was amply confirmed, and details
infinitely more abundant and interesting afforded. At
8 o’clock on this evening, the Intendant received a visit
from a gentleman, who is advantageously known in this
community for his worth and respectability.</p>

<p class='c005'>This gentleman, with an anxiety, which the occasion
was well calculated to beget, stated to the Intendant,
that, having the most unbounded confidence in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>a faithful slave belonging to his family, who was distinguished
alike for his uncommon intelligence and integrity,
he was induced to inform him, that rumors
were abroad of an intended insurrection of the blacks,
and that it was said, that this movement had been
traced to some of the coloured members of Dr. Palmer’s
church, in which he was known to be a class leader.—On
being strongly enjoined to conceal nothing, he, the
next day, Friday the 14th, came to his master, and informed
him, that the fact was really so, that a public
disturbance was contemplated by the blacks, and not a
moment should be lost in informing the constituted authorities,
as the succeeding Sunday, the 16th, at 12
o’clock, at night, was the period fixed for the rising,
which, if not prevented, would inevitably occur at that
hour. This slave, it appears, was in no degree connected
with the plot, but he had an intimate friend, A——
(one of his class) who had been trusted by the conspirators
with the secret, and had been solicited by them to
join their association; to this A—— first appeared to consent,
but, on no period absolutely sent in his adhesion.
According to the statement which he afterwards made
himself to the Court, it would seem that it was a subject
of great regret and contrition with him, that he
had ever appeared to lend his approbation to a scheme
so wicked and atrocious, and that he sought occasion to
make atonement, by divulging the plot, which on the
14th he did, to the slave of the gentleman in question,
his class leader.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>This gentleman, therefore, mentioned, that his servant
had informed him, that A——<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> had stated, that
about three months ago, Rolla, belonging to Governor
Bennett, had communicated to him the intelligence of
the intended insurrection, and had asked him to join—‘That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>he remarked, in the event of their rising, they
would not be without help, as the people from San
Domingo and Africa would assist them in obtaining
their liberty, if they only made the motion first themselves.
That if A—— wished to know more, he had
better attend their meetings, where all would be disclosed.’
After this, at another interview, Rolla informed
A——, that ‘the plan was matured, and that
on Sunday night, the 16th June, a force would cross
from James’ Island and land on South Bay, march up
and seize the Arsenal and Guard-House, that another
body at the same time would seize the Arsenal on the
Neck, and a third would rendezvous in the vicinity of
his master’s mills. They would then sweep the town
with fire and sword, not permitting a single white soul
to escape.’</p>

<p class='c009'>As this account was remarkably coincident with the
one given by William (Mr. Paul’s slave) as the witnesses
could have had no possible communication, or the story
have been the result of preconcert and combination,
the sum of this intelligence was laid before the Governor
by 9 o’clock, and by 10 o’clock the commanding
officers of the regiments of the City militia, convened by
his Excellency’s order, at the residence of the Intendant.
On this and the succeeding afternoon, at another
meeting of the same individuals, such measures were
determined on by his Excellency, as were deemed best
adapted to the approaching exigency of Sunday night.</p>

<p class='c005'>On Sunday the 16th, at 10 o’clock at night, the following
corps were ordered to rendezvous for guard—</p>

<p class='c005'>Capt. Cattel’s Corps of <i>Hussars</i>, Capt. Miller’s <i>Light
Infantry</i>, Capt. Martindale’s <i>Neck Rangers</i>, <i>Charleston
Riflemen</i>, and <i>City Guard</i>.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>The whole were organized as a detachment, and
placed under the command of Col. R. Y. Hayne. Although
there was necessarily great excitement, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>among the female part of our community much alarm,
yet, the night passed off without any thing like commotion
or disturbance, and it is peculiarly honorable to
the corps on service, that in a populous town, the streets
filled until a late hour with persons, uncertain whether
it was safe to go to <i>rest</i> or <i>not</i>, not a single case of false
alarm was excited. A steadiness altogether praiseworthy,
in troops unaccustomed to guard duty, at least on
an occasion involving such deep interest and distressing
anxiety.</p>

<p class='c005'>The conspirators finding the whole town encompassed
at 10 o’clock, by the most vigilant patrols, did not
dare to show themselves, whatever might have been
their plans. In the progress of the subsequent investigation,
it was distinctly in proof, that but for these military
demonstrations, the effort would unquestionably
have been made; that a meeting took place on Sunday
afternoon, the 16th, at 4 o’clock, of several of the ringleaders,
at Denmark Vesey’s, for the purpose of making
their preliminary arrangements, and that early in the
morning of Sunday, Denmark despatched a courier, to
order down some country negroes from Goose Creek,
which courier had endeavored in vain to get out of
town.</p>

<p class='c005'>No developement of the plot having been made on
Sunday night, and the period having passed, which
was fixed on for its explosion, it now became the duty
of the civil authority to take immediate steps for the
apprehension, commitment, and trial of those against
whom they were in possession of information. Council
was accordingly convened, and as a preliminary
measure, it was deemed expedient, that a Court of the
highest respectability, for the talents and integrity of
its members, should be assembled, and that, whilst the
requisitions of the Act of Assembly, of 1740, should be
strictly complied with, in devolving the warrant of summons
on the Magistrates; the Corporation saw no impropriety
in affording these officers a list of such names
of Freeholders, as they knew would meet in a preeminent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>degree the public approbation; and to these
persons private letters were written by the authority of
Council, strongly soliciting their acceptance of a trust,
involving indeed the most irksome labour, as well as the
deepest responsibility. In conformity with these arrangements,
the following Court was organized on the
evening of the 17th:—</p>

<p class='c005'>Cotemporaneously with the organization of this
Court, a Committee of Vigilance and Safety was appointed
from among the Members of Council, to aid the
Intendant in the execution of the laws; to co-operate
with him during the recess of Council, in all those
measures necessary for exploring the causes and character
of the existing disturbance, and bringing to light
and punishment the suspected and guilty. How ably
these functions were discharged by this Committee, it
is not befitting the occasion or the circumstances under
which this publication appears to dwell. Their generous
devotion and unremitting assiduity to the public
interests and safety, are left to the more appropriate
appreciation of a community that witnessed their labours.
This Committee consisted of Messrs. Wesner,
Napier, Condy, Burger, and Simons, and were zealously
aided by the rest of the Wardens; and for
its service, four of the most active, intelligent, and confidential
non-commissioned officers of the City Guard,
were detached as Police Officers, to search suspected
places, and to apprehend those for whom warrants
might be issued. This Committee commenced its labours
on the night of the 17th, and during the ensuing
twenty-four hours, the following slaves were committed:—<i>Rolla</i>,
<i>Batteau</i>, <i>Matthias</i> and <i>Ned</i>, the property
of the Governor Bennett; <i>Mungo</i> and <i>Peter</i>, the property
of James Poyas; <i>Amhurst</i>, the property of Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Lining; <i>Stephen</i>, the property of T. R. Smith; <i>Richard</i>
and <i>John</i>, the property of Jonathan Lucas.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the morning of the 19th of June, the Court of
Magistrates and Freeholders assembled at the Court-House,
were sworn in, and proceeded to the arraignment
of the above prisoners for trial. Who were
charged “<i>with attempting to raise an insurrection
among the Blacks against the Whites</i>.” In order
that the public may understand the offence as defined
in the Act of 1740, the clause, at length, will be found
in the Appendix, marked (A.)</p>

<p class='c005'>Before we proceed to a brief (and it necessarily must
be very brief) abstract of the testimony offered in the
cases brought before the Court, it may not be unimportant
to observe, that, previous to their proceeding to
the painful investigation with which they were charged,
they laid down a variety of rules for their government,
all of them subservient to justice as well as humanity.
In the first place, it was decided, that the testimony
should be regulated by those established rules of evidence,
which are elsewhere found so important in the
exposition of truth; that no slave should be tried but in
the presence of his Master or his Attorney; that the
testimony of one witness, unsupported by circumstances,
should lead to no conviction involving capital
punishment; and that the statement of the party himself,
should be heard in explanation of such particulars,
as seemed most inculpatory.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE COURT,</h3>

<p class='c014'>Being thus organized, they proceeded to the trial of
ROLLA, the slave of Governor Bennett:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Jacob Axson</span>, Esq. attending as Attorney of his master.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was proved, that <i>Rolla</i> had confessed to two persons,
both of whom were examined by the Court, that
he belonged to the conspiracy, and with one of these
witnesses (his friend) he used every effort to induce
him to join in the insurrection, which Rolla stated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>was to take place on the night of the 16th of June.—Finding
that this friend (the witness in question) would
not join the association, he urged him to go out of
town on Sunday night, lest some harm should come to
him. Rolla represented himself as the commander of
the Force which was to rendezvous in the vicinity of his
master’s mills, and explained to the witness fully the
order of attack; the division of the forces; and said,
“that his troops, in their way into town, would fix
his Old Buck (his master) and the Intendant.” On
being asked whether it was intended to kill the women
and children, he remarked when we have done
with the men we know what to do with the women.—On
this testimony Rolla was found <i>guilty</i>, and sentenced
to be executed on the 2d of July.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>BATTEAU was next tried—</p>

<p class='c005'>It was proved that <i>Batteau</i> confessed to two persons
(both of whom were introduced as witnesses) that he
belonged to the conspiracy, and made efforts to induce
them to join in the rising, by representing the extent
of their preparations, and the probability of their success.
He stated he was to head a party near Canon’s
bridge, and that he expected aid from the country.—More
than one interview took place between Batteau
and the witnesses on the subject; the last, on the Sunday
fixed for the insurrection, on which he renewed
his solicitations that the witnesses should join him.—Batteau
was found <i>guilty</i>, and sentenced to be executed
on the 2d of July.</p>

<p class='c009'>STEPHEN, belonging to Thos. R. Smith, Esq.</p>

<p class='c005'>Was next brought before the Court, but the testimony
being deemed insufficient, and indeed, the Court
being satisfied of his innocence, directed his <i>discharge</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>PETER, the slave of Mr. James Poyas, was next tried.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was distinctly in proof, against <i>Peter</i>, that he had
made great efforts to induce others to join in the insurrection;
and the testimony represented him quite in
the character of a chieftain or leader, for which his
boldness and sagacity unquestionably qualified him.—He
appeared, from the testimony, to have employed
uncommon pains to remove all the objections arising
in the minds of those whom he attempted to enlist, as
to the probability of the success of the effort. And
spoke with great confidence of the succors which were
expected from San Domingo. It was strongly to be
inferred, from all the witnesses stated, that the difficult
and dangerous sally of endeavouring to carry the
Main Guard-House was to have been confided to him,
for he particularly acquainted one of the witnesses with
the combination of stratagem and force with which he
proposed to accomplish this object.</p>

<p class='c005'>Peter was found <i>guilty</i> on this testimony, and sentenced
for execution on the 2d of July.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>AMHERST, belonging to Mrs. Lining, was next examined,
found <i>not guilty</i>, and <i>discharged</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Court then proceeded to the trial of NED, the
property of Governor Bennett.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Ned’s</i> guilt was proved fully by the same witnesses
that appeared against Peter Poyas, with whom it was
established he was in the habit of frequent consultation
on the efforts that were to be made. Subsequent disclosures
have justified very strongly the finding of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Court against him, and placed it beyond a doubt, that
he was a ringleader, and was to have headed a force in
the vicinity of the Lines.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was found <i>guilty</i>, and sentenced for execution on
the 2d of July.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 24th of June, the Court discharged as <i>not
guilty</i>, <i>Samuel Guifford</i> and <i>Robert Hadden</i>, two free
persons of colour, as also <i>Matthias</i>, the slave of Governor
Bennett; <i>Mungo</i>, the slave of Mr. Poyas; <i>Robert</i>,
the slave of Mr. Harth, and <i>Richard</i> and <i>John</i>, the slaves
of Mr. Lucas.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the 25th of June, the Court examined the cases
of <i>Jim</i>, belonging to Mr. Ancrum; <i>Sandy</i>, belonging to
Mr. Holmes, and <i>Friday</i>, the property of Mr. Rout, all
of whom were found <i>not guilty</i>, and <i>discharged</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>On Wednesday, the 26th of June, the Court proceeded
to the trial of ABRAHAM, the slave of Dr.
Poyas.</p>

<p class='c005'>The only proof adduced against <i>Abraham</i>, was the
following letter, found in the trunk of Peter Poyas,
and acknowledged by Abraham to have been written
by himself,—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c005'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—With pleasure I give you an answer. I will endeavour
to do it. Hoping that God will be in the midst to help his
own. Be particular and make a sure remark. Fear not, the Lord
God that delivered Daniel is able to deliver us. All that I inform
agreed. I am gone up to Beach-Hill.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>(Signed)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Abraham Poyas</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</blockquote>

<p class='c005'>Although this letter was extremely suspicious, yet,
there being no other testimony against Abraham, he
was found <i>not guilty</i> of the charge ‘of attempting to
raise an insurrection among the blacks against the
whites.’</p>

<p class='c016'>On Thursday the 27th, DENMARK VESEY, a free
black man, was brought before the Court for trial,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Assisted by his Counsel, <span class='sc'>G. W. Cross</span>, Esq.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It is perhaps somewhat remarkable, that at this stage
of the investigation, although several witnesses had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>been examined, the <i>atrocious</i> guilt of <i>Denmark Vesey</i>
had not been as yet fully unfolded. From the testimony
of most of the witnesses, however, the Court
found enough, and amply enough, to warrant the sentence
of death, which, on the 28th, they passed on
him. But every subsequent step in the progress of the
trials of others, lent new confirmation to his overwhelming
guilt, and placed him beyond a doubt, on the
criminal eminence of having been the individual, in
whose bosom the nefarious scheme was first engendered.
There is ample reason for believing, that this project
was not, with him, of recent origin, for it was said,
he had spoken of it for upwards of four years.</p>

<p class='c005'>These facts of his guilt the journals of the Court
will disclose—that no man can be proved to have spoken
of or urged the insurrection prior to himself. All
the channels of communication and intelligence are
traced back to him. His house was the place appointed
for the secret meetings of the conspirators, at which
he was invariably a leading and influential member;
animating and encouraging the timid, by the hopes of
prospects of success; removing the scruples of the religious,
by the grossest prostitution and perversion of the
sacred oracles, and inflaming and confirming the resolute,
by all the savage fascinations of blood and booty.</p>

<p class='c005'>The peculiar circumstances of guilt, which confer a
distinction on his case, will be found narrated in the
confessions of Rolla, Monday Gell, Frank and
Jesse, in the Appendix. He was sentenced for execution
on the 2d July.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The Court tried JESSE, the slave of Mr. Thomas
Blackwood.</p>

<p class='c005'>The testimony against <i>Jesse</i> was very ample. His
activity and zeal, in promoting the views of Denmark
Vesey, in relation to the plot, were fully proved. He
had engaged with Vesey to go out of town on Sunday
the 16th, to bring down some negroes from the country,
to aid in the rising on that night; and remarked, to the
witnesses, on his way to Hibbens’ ferry, “if my father
does not assist I will cut off his head.” All the
particulars in proof against him, he confirmed after receiving
his sentence, by his own full and satisfactory
Confession, which will be found in the Appendix,
marked (H.)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>This man excited no small sympathy, not only from
the apparent sincerity of his contrition, but from the
mild and unostentatious composure with which he
met his fate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sentence of death was passed on these six men, on
the 28th of June, and they were executed on the 2d
of July. With the exception of Jesse and Rolla, they
made no disclosures; all of them, with those exceptions,
either explicitly or implicitly affirming their innocence.
It is much to be lamented that the situation
of the Work-House, at this period, precluded,
after their sentence, their being separately confined;
at least, that Vesey could not have been subjected to the
gloom and silence of a solitary cell. He might have
been softened, and afforded the most precious confessions,
as his knowledge and agency in the nefarious
scheme very far exceeded the information of others,
who, however guilty, seemed but the agents of his will.
But these men mutually supported each other, and died
obedient to the stern and emphatic injunction of their
Comrade (Peter Poyas) “<i>Do not open your lips! Die
silent, as you shall see me do!</i>” It was, perhaps, <i>alone</i>,
in Denmark Vesey’s power, to have given us the true
character, extent and importance of the correspondence,
it was afterwards proved, was carried on with certain
persons in San Domingo.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 1st of July the Court proceeded to the trial
of MONDAY GELL, who, together with CHARLES
DRAYTON, had been apprehended; the first, on the
27th of June, and the latter, on the 2d of July.</p>

<p class='c005'>By referring to the Appendix (D.) &amp; (E.) the nature
of the testimony against these individuals will be seen.
In reference to the case of <i>Monday Gell</i> it was established
that he had been a very important ringleader,
and that his shop, in Meeting-Street, was a place at
which many meetings were held; at all of which he
was present, lending the most zealous aid, and affording
the strongest countenance; and if any confirmation
of his guilt should be sought for, it may be found in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>own confession in the Appendix (K.) After Monday
Gell and Charles Drayton were convicted there appeared
to be a pause in our further discoveries, and
some prospect of the investigation closing with their
execution and that of John Horry, Harry Haig and
Gullah Jack, (for the guilt of the latter, see Appendix
(D.) (E.) &amp; (F.))</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 9th of July, however, these five men, were
called before the Court to receive sentence, and after
it had been pronounced, with the most impressive solemnity,
they were withdrawn to a common ward in
the Work-House, for half an hour, until separate cells
could be provided for them. It was at this moment
that <i>Charles Drayton</i>, overwhelmed with terror and
guilt, went up to <i>Monday</i> and reproached him with
having induced him to join in a scheme which had
placed him in such a miserable and perilous situation.
To this appeal Monday, not only confessed his guilt,
but observed to Charles—that their present fate was
justly and precisely what they had a right to expect,
after their detected and defeated project. On which
there immediately ensued between them a conversation
on the extent of the guilt of others, in which Monday
gave Charles the names of many accomplices
whom he had not previously known in the plot;—the
arrival of the blacksmith to iron the convicts, and the
turnkey to convey them to separate cells, interrupted
the conversation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Charles, during the night of the 9th, sent for Mr.
Gordon, who has charge of the Work-House, and informed
him that he was extremely anxious to see the Intendant,
as he had some important disclosures to make.
By day-light, on the morning of the 10th, this message
was conveyed to the person for whom it was intended,
and Charles was visited at sun-rise. He was found,
in a state of the most lamentable depression and panic,
and he seemed prepared to make the most ample declarations
from the fear of death, and the consequences
of an <i>hereafter</i>, if he went out of the world without
revealing all that he knew, in relation to the Conspiracy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>in which he had been so active an agent. Before
his narrative was received, he was most specially put on
his guard, that no promises could be made to him of a
reversal of his fate, but that he might rest satisfied,
his condition could not be worse by his coming out
with a full disclosure of all that he knew. He then
stated many particulars, that had come to his own
knowledge, proving a much wider diffusion of the
plot than, at that period, was imagined; and, after
giving up the names of several of his comrades, he
mentioned the conversation which had been commenced
and broken off, in the common ward of the Work-House,
between Monday Gell and himself. As Monday,
at this period, did not seem disposed to make any
confessions to others, whatever he might be inclined
to do to his friend Charles, it was considered important,
that the conversation between them should
be renewed, and they were brought together in
the same cell, and left for twenty-four hours
alone; but some little stratagem was employed, to divert
the suspicions of Monday, that Charles was confined
with him, merely for the purpose of getting information
out of him.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the morning of the 10th, the Court were convened,
and apprized, generally, of these new disclosures,
which Charles had made, but as he was still <i>closeted</i>
with Monday, he could not be examined on that day,
the Court adjourned to meet on the 13th; on which
day Monday Gell’s own confession was heard by them.
Between the 10th and 13th, <i>Charles</i> and <i>Monday</i> were
separated (having been respited by His Excellency, the
Governor, at the request of the Court) and Charles, on
his re-examination afforded much important information,
which he had derived from Monday. On Monday’s
having all this brought to his view, he confessed
his own guilt, as well as the truth of the statements
which he had made to Charles.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Cotemporaneously with these communications, PERAULT,
belonging to Mr. Strohecker, was taken up,
on the 10th, and on his being closely and judiciously
examined by his master, he gave a large mass of intelligence
confirming what had been related by Monday
and Charles, and supplying several deficiencies in their
testimony, more especially that part of it which related
to the transmission of <i>certain</i> letters to San Domingo.
These disclosures, with some further details which were
obtained from Harry Haig, (whose confession and subsequent
testimony went to implicate a corps of Gullah
or Angola negroes, that had been organized under the
command of their Chief, Gullah Jack,) gave ample
employment for three or four days to the Committee of
Vigilance, during which upwards of sixty slaves were
apprehended.</p>

<p class='c005'>It would very much transcend the limits necessarily
prescribed to this brief memoir, to go over all the
trials that subsequently ensued, on these fresh discoveries.
As the most important part of the testimony,
adduced on these trials, is to be found in the Appendix,
it is deemed altogether, superfluous, to make a special
application of it to each of the cases, as this would
result in a repetition fatiguing and uninteresting to the
reader. It will be sufficient to single out a few of the
cases most pregnant in interest, and to remark, that the
Court on its reorganization on the 13th, justly estimating
the extent of the labour before them, laid down
certain rules of discrimination in the guilt of the parties
to which they give the most definite precision and
perspicuity, by adopting two classes of offence; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>first involving a primary and the second a minor degree
of guilt. Under the first class, they brought all those
who were ringleaders, who had made a declaration of
their belonging to the association, and who had been
present, aiding and abetting in the contribution of
money, arms or ammunition, at Denmark Vesey’s, or
who were in the constant habit of visiting Monday
Gell’s shop and Bulkley’s farm, for the purpose of
obtaining and communicating intelligence of the progress
of the conspiracy. Those found guilty in this class,
were to be punished with death. Under the second
class were arranged those who had merely sent in their
adhesion to the ringleaders without ever having attended
a meeting at Vesey’s, or having been recognized by
him as confidential men, or contributed to the
purchase of arms or ammunition, or endeavoured to
enlist others. The punishment which awaited those
found guilty in this class, was transportation beyond
the limits of the United States.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>By reference to the Calendar marked (S) in the
Appendix, the names of the prisoners committed will
be found, and under a proper column, the mode in
which they were disposed of, whether by death, transportation,
or discharge, from the insufficiency of testimony.
The extent of the evidence adduced, therefore,
against each individual, may be inferred with accuracy,
by observing the punishment awarded him; as the
Court adhered with great and rigid fidelity to these
rules, which were in unison both with justice and
humanity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among the vast number of cases disposed of by the
first Court; in a session of nearly six weeks, involving
the most intense and unremitting labour, it would be
impossible to overlook the case of Jack Pritchard,
otherwise called GULLAH JACK. The testimony
in the Appendix, of more than one of the witnesses, will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>establish fully his guilt, and prove the justice of the
sentence, by which he was ushered into another world;
but no description can accurately convey to others the
impression which his trial, defence and appearance
made on those who witnessed the workings of his
cunning and rude address. Born a conjurer and a physician,
in his own country (for in Angola they are matters
of inheritance) he practised <i>these arts</i> in this country
for fifteen years, without its being generally known
among the whites. Vesey, who left no engines of
power unessayed, seems, in an early stage of his design,
to have turned his eye on this Necromancer, aware of
his influence with his own countrymen, who are distinguished
both for their credulous superstition and
clannish sympathies. It does not appear that Jack
required much persuasion to induce him to join in a
project, which afforded him the most ample opportunities
of displaying his peculiar art, whilst it is very obvious
that his willingness, to do all that Vesey might
require, was in no little degree stimulated, by his bitterness
and his gall against the whites. Altho’ he had been
fifteen or twenty years in this country, yet he appeared
to be untouched by the influences of civilized life.—If
the part which he was to play in this drama, bespoke
that the treacherous and vindictive artifices of
war in his own country, existed in unimpaired vigour in
his memory, his wildness and vehemence of gesture and
the malignant glance with which he eyed the witnesses
who appeared against him, all indicated the savage,
who indeed had been <i>caught</i>, but not <i>tamed</i>. It would
be both tedious and disgusting to relate the many artifices
employed by this miscreant to deceive and cajole
his deluded countrymen. Such was their belief in his
invulnerability, that his charms and amulets were in
request, and he was regarded as a man, who could <i>only</i>
be harmed but by the <i>treachery</i> of his fellows. Even
those negroes who were born in this country seem to
have spoken of his charmed invincibility with a confidence
which looked much like belief. When Jack
was dragged forth to the scaffold he seemed conscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>that his arts would stand him in little stead, and gave
up his spirit without firmness or composure.</p>

<p class='c009'>The case of TOM RUSSEL, another of the Gullah
Band, deserves a brief notice. He was tried some
days after Jack, and was executed among the twenty-two
Criminals hung on the Lines, on the 26th July.
Tom was Jack’s <i>armourer</i>, and kept his blacksmith’s
shop on East-Bay. His part in the conspiracy was
confined to the making of pikes and spears, which it
appears he did on a very approved model. After these
weapons were finished, they were held subject to the order
of Jack, and by him sent up to Mr. Bulkley’s farm,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
near the Cross Roads, where handles were provided for
them by Polydore Faber, a Gullah, who met his fate
on the same scaffold with Tom Russel. This farm
was one of the principal rendezvous of the Gullah
Band, of which Jack was the Captain.</p>

<p class='c009'>The trial of LOT FORRESTER, was not without
interest, as he was the <i>courier</i> of the conspiracy, and
was proved to have gone out of town, for the purpose
of inducing the country negroes to join in the insurrection;
his journeys were both south and north of
Charleston. His zeal and perseverance in the cause
were strongly proved, and there is every reason for
believing that the conflagration of the city was confided,
by Vesey, to him. Match-rope was found in a situation
where he had probably secreted it.—He was
hung on the Lines on the 26th of July.</p>

<p class='c009'>BACCHUS HAMMETT, who was hung, also, on
the 26th, did render, and was to have rendered, on
the night of the 16th, the most essential aid. Before
the latter period he had stolen from his master’s store
a keg of powder, which was conveyed, first to Vesey’s
afterwards to Monday Gell’s, and lastly to Gullah
Jack, to be prepared into cartridges. On the night
of the 16th he was to have slept where the arms of the
<i>Neck-Rangers</i> were deposited, and facilitated their
seizure and distribution among Gullah Jack’s corps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>who were to have carried this post, as well as Mr.
<i>Duquercron’s</i> store, in which there were 500 stands of
arms, deposited for sale.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cases of JACK GLEN, BILLY PALMER,
and JACK PURCELL, are distinguished, not by
any peculiar atrocity, but for the hypocrisy they blended
with their crime. Their assent to the plot was
distinctly shown, and it was in proof, that Vesey had
recognized them all as his men. Jack Glen was
a Preacher. Billy Palmer, exceedingly pious, and a
communicant at the church of his master; and Jack
Purcell no less devout. The case of the latter was not
without its pathos, from the deep contrition he expressed
before his execution; the distressing interest
which his mistress is said to have taken in his fate, and
the lamentable delusion under which he laboured,
which is more particularly unfolded in his confession,
in the Appendix marked (L.)<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Jack Glen and Purcell
were hung on the Lines. Billy Palmer has been
respited by His Excellency, the Governor, until October
next, for a commutation of his punishment to
banishment beyond the limits of the United States.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Court having used the testimony of <i>Monday
Gell</i>, <i>Charles Drayton</i> and <i>Harry Haig</i>, very efficaciously,
to the ends of public justice, reconsidered
the sentences, which had been passed on them, and
instead of death, sentenced them to transportation
beyond the limits of the United States.</p>

<p class='c009'>As a matter of form, <i>Perault</i>, <i>John Enslow</i> and
<i>Billy Bulkley</i>, (who had become witnesses for the
state,) were then tried on their own confessions, and
sentenced to be transported beyond the limits of the
United States. These individuals were important
witnesses in all the apprehensions and trials subsequent
to the 13th of July.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perault gave his testimony with great fearlessness
and candour, and Enslow with much composure and
connexion; the evidence of both, as well indeed as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>that of most of the witnesses, was much appreciated
by the Court, after a severe scrutiny.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>This Court, having disposed of all the cases before
them, adjourned on the 26th of July.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this stage of our investigation we were satisfied
that of all the ringleaders in the conspiracy,
<i>William Garner</i>, (who had effected his escape from
the city about the 1st of July) only, remained to be
punished. As information had been received of his
having travelled towards Columbia, a proclamation
was issued by His Excellency, the Governor, for his
apprehension, in promotion of the success of which some
subsidiary steps were taken by private means. On the
2d of August our wishes, relating to Garner, were gratified,
by his arrival in town. He had previously been
arrested at Columbia, thro’ the public spirited efforts
of the Intendant of that place and Lieut. Maxcy,
who overtook and apprehended him at Granby.</p>

<p class='c005'>On Garner’s arrival, a new Court was organized
for his trial, and such other cases as might be brought
before them, by precisely the same means as those
which had been employed on the appointment of the
first; and the services of the following gentlemen secured,
who were known to possess, deservedly, a large
share of the public confidence.</p>

<p class='c005'>This Court adopted the same rules for their government
which had been so humanely and dispassionately
adopted by the preceding Court, but, as enough
had been done for public example, they determined
to visit capital punishment on none but ringleaders.
The first case they tried was that of WILLIAM
GARNER.</p>

<p class='c005'>Garner’s guilt had all the characteristics, which the
Court had assigned to the first class of turpitude; it
was not only proved that he was actively engaged in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>recruiting others, but that he was to have led a
troop of horse, at the rising, composed of all such of
the conspirators as might have appeared in the streets
on horseback. And further, that he had made an
offer of a command to others in his corps. Four
witnesses having sworn positively to his guilt, detailing
a variety of particulars, mutually corroborating
and supporting each other, he was found guilty and
sentenced for execution on the 9th of August, at which
period the sentence was carried into effect. This Court
having, after a short adjournment, of three or four,
days recommenced their session, disposed of twelve
cases more, involving a minor degree of guilt, and
adjourned finally on the 8th of August.</p>

<p class='c005'>These trials, together with some private arrangements,
made with their owners, in reference to the
banishment of several slaves, in cases where their
guilt was clear, but not of the first degree, have at
length closed the anxious and irksome labours of the
corporation, after an examination of little less than
two months.</p>

<p class='c005'>It will be seen, by referring to the Calendar marked
(S) that one hundred and thirty-one were committed;
thirty-five have suffered death, and thirty-seven have
been sentenced to banishment. The most important
object to be obtained in uprooting a conspiracy, we
have fully accomplished, by bringing to punishment
the whole of the ringleaders. Monday Gell, whose
knowledge of the plot was, probably, exceeded only
by Vesey’s, has emphatically stated, that the ringleaders
were the first six, who were executed on the 2d of
July, to wit: Denmark Vesey, Peter Poyas, Ned Bennett,
Rolla, Batteau and Jesse; to which he has since
added himself and William Garner, who was executed
on the 9th of August.</p>

<p class='c005'>We, moreover, believe, that all who were active
agents (though not ringleaders) in the conspiracy,
have expiated their crimes, or are about to do so, by
an eternal exile from our shores. It may be mentioned,
in confirmation of this belief, that Monday Gell, from
memory, made out a list of forty-two names, of those
who were in the habit of visiting his shop, for the purpose
of combining and confederating in the intended
insurrection, whom he called his company; every one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>whom have been apprehended, and disposed of. We
cannot venture to say, to how many the knowledge of
the intended effort, was communicated, who, without
signifying their assent, or attending any of the meetings,
were yet prepared to profit by events. That
there are many who would not have permitted the
enterprize to have failed at a <i>critical moment</i>, for the
want of their co-operation, we have the best reasons
for believing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before we conclude, some notice of the probable
causes of this conspiracy may be expected. As this is
a matter of speculation, we shall not speak without
reserve. Of the motives of Vesey, we cannot sit in
judgment; they have been scanned by a power who
can do higher justice than ourselves. But as they are
explained by his character and conduct, during the
combinations of the plot, they are only to be referred
to a malignant hatred of the whites, and inordinate lust
of power and booty. Indeed, the belief is altogether
justifiable, that his end would have been answered, if,
after laying our city in ashes, and moistening its cinders
with blood, he could have embarked with a part
of the pillage of our banks for San Domingo; leaving
a large proportion of his deluded followers to the exterminating
desolation of that justice, which would have
awaited, in the end, a transient success. His followers
were slaves, and for them it would not be so difficult
to assign a motive, if it had not been distinctly
proved, that without, scarcely an exception, they had
no individual hardship to complain of, and were
among the most humanely treated negroes in our city.
The facilities for combining and confederating in such
a scheme, were amply afforded, by the extreme indulgence
and kindness, which characterises the domestic
treatment of our slaves. Many slave owners among
us, not satisfied with ministering to the wants of
their domestics, by all the comforts of abundant food,
and excellent clothing, with a misguided benevolence,
have not only permitted their instruction, but lent to
such efforts their approbation and applause.</p>

<p class='c005'>Religious fanaticism has not been without its effect
on this project, and as auxiliary to these sentiments, the
secession of a large body of blacks from the white
Methodist Church, with feelings of irritation and disappointment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>formed a hot-bed, in which the germ
might well be expected to spring into life and vigour.
Among the conspirators <i>a majority</i> of them belonged
to the <i>African Church</i>,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and among those executed
were several who had been Class Leaders. It is, however,
due to the late head of their church (for since
the late events the association has been voluntarily
dissolved) and their deacons, to say, that after the
most diligent search and scrutiny, no evidence entitled
to belief, has been discovered against them. A hearsay
rumour, in relation to <i>Morris Brown</i>, was traced
far enough to end in its complete falsification.</p>

<p class='c005'>That the course which certain discussions assumed
in Congress were likewise efficacious in producing
both discontent and delusion, is sufficiently apparent.
Jack Purcell’s confession in the Appendix, will show to
what a purpose Vesey applied those beautiful propositions
of civil and natural freedom, which were
sported with a wanton recklessness of their consequences,
as applied to the condition of a certain portion
of our common country.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is consoling to every individual, who is proud of
the character of his country, in the late unhappy
events, to be able to say, that, within the limits of the
City of Charleston, in a period of great and unprecedented
excitement, the laws, without even one violation,
have ruled with uninterrupted sway—that no cruel
vindictive or barbarous modes of punishment have
been resorted to—that justice has been blended with
an enlightened humanity, in according to those who
had meted out for us murder, rapine and conflagration,
in their most savage forms—trials, which, for the wisdom,
impartiality and moderation that governed them,
are even superior to those which the ordinary modes
of judicature would have afforded ourselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>With little to fear, and nothing to reproach ourselves
we may, without shrinking, submit our conduct to the
award of posterity, and ourselves to the protection of
the Supreme Ruler of Events.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>(B.)</h3>

<p class='c014'>A negro man testified as follows:<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c008'><sup>[15]</sup></a>—I know Peter, he belongs to
Mr. James Poyas; in May last, Peter and myself met in Legare street,
at the corner of Lambol street, where the following conversation took
place—He asked me the news—I replied, none that I know of—He
said, by George! we can’t live so. I replied, how will we do? He
said, we can do very well, if you can find any one to assist us—will
you join? I asked him, how do you mean? He said, why! to break
the yoke; I replied, I don’t know. He asked me, suppose you were
to hear, that the whites were going to kill you, would you defend yourself?
I replied, I’d try to escape. He asked, have you lately seen
<i>Denmark Vesey</i>, and has he spoken to you particularly. I said no.
Well then, said he, that’s all now: but call at the shop to-morrow after
knocking off work, and I will tell you more! We then parted.—I
met him the next day, according to appointment, when he said to
me, we intend to see, if we can’t do something for ourselves, we can’t
live so. I asked him, where he would get men? He said, we’ll find
them fast enough, we have got enough, we expect men from country
and town. But how, said I, will you manage it. Why, we will give
them notice, said he, and they will march down and camp round the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>city. But what, said I, will they do for arms. He answered, they
will find arms enough, they all bring down their hoes, axes, &amp;c. I
said, that won’t do to fight with here. He said, stop! let us get candidates
from town with arms, and we will then take the Guard-House
and Arsenal in town, the Arsenal on the Neck and the Upper Guard-House,
and supply the country people with arms. How, said I, will
you approach those Arsenals, &amp;c. for they are guarded? Yes, said he,
I know that, but what are these guards, one man here, and one man
there, we let a man pass before us. Well, said I, but how will the
black people from the country, and those from the islands, know
when you are to begin, or how will you get the town people together.
Why, said he, we will have prayer meetings at night, and there notify
them when to start, and when the clock strikes twelve, <i>all must move</i>.
But, said I, the whites in the back country, Virginia, &amp;c.; when they
hear the news, will turn to, and kill you all, and besides, you may be
betrayed. Well said he, what of that, if one gets hanged, we will rise
at that minute. We then left his shop, and walked towards Broad
street, when he said, I want you to take notice of all the shops and
stores in town with arms in them, take <i>down their numbers, and give
them to me</i>. I said, I will see to it, and then we parted.</p>

<p class='c005'>About the 1st of June, I saw in the public papers a statement that
the white people were going to build missionary houses for the blacks,
which I carried and showed to Peter, and said, see the good they are
going to do for us; when, he said,—What of that?—Have you not
heard, that on the 4th of July, the whites are going to create a false
alarm of fire, and every <i>black</i> that comes out will be <i>killed</i>, in order
<i>to thin them</i>? Do you think they would be so barbarous? (said I)
Yes! (said he) I do!—I fear <i>they have a knowledge of an army
from San Domingo</i>, and they would be <i>right to do it; to prevent us
joining that army, if it should march towards this land</i>! I was then
very much alarmed. We then parted, and I saw no more of him till
the guards were very strict, (about a fortnight ago.) At that time I
saw Peter and Ned Bennett standing and talking together, at the corner
of Lambol and Legare-streets. They crossed over and met me
by Mrs. Myles’, and Ned Bennett said to me—did you hear what
those boys were taken up for the other day?  I replied, No! but
some say it was for stealing. Ned asked me if I was sure I had never
said any thing to the whites about what Peter Poyas had spoken to
me about? I replied, No! Says Peter—You never did? No! I
answered. Says Ned, to me—How do you stand? At which I
struck the tree box with my knuckles and said, as firm as this box—I’ll
never say one word against you. Ned then smiled and nodded
his head, and said—That will do!—when we all separated. Last
Tuesday or Wednesday week, Peter said to me—You see, my lad,
how the white people have got to windward of us? You won’t, said
I, be able to do any thing. O, yes! (he said) we will! By George
we are oblige to! He said, all down this way ought to meet and
have a collection to purchase powder. What, said I, is the use of
powder—the whites can fire three times to our once. He said, but
<i>’twill be such a dead time of the night, they won’t know what is the
matter, and our horse companies will go about the streets and prevent
the whites from assembling</i>. I asked him—where will you get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>horses? Why, said he, there are many butcher boys with horses;
and there are the livery stables, where we have several candidates;
and the waiting men, belonging to the white people of the horse
companies, will be told to take away their master’s horses. He
asked me if my master was not a horseman? I said, Yes! Has
he not got arms in his house? I answered, Yes! Can’t they be got
at? I said, Yes! Then (said he) it is good to have them. I asked
what was the plan? Why, said he, after we have taken the Arsenals
and Guard Houses, then we will set the town on fire, in different
places, and as the whites come out we will slay them. If we were to
set fire to the town first the man in the steeple would give the alarm too
soon.—I am the Captain, said he, to take the lower Guard-House and
Arsenal. But, I replied, when you are coming up, the Centinel will
give the alarm. He said, he would advance a little distance ahead,
and if he could only get a <i>grip at his throat, he was a gone man</i>, for
his sword was very sharp; he had sharpened it, and had made it so
sharp, it had cut his finger, which he showed me. As to the Arsenal
on the Neck, he said, that it was gone as sure as fate, <i>Ned Bennett,
would manage that with the people from the country, and the people
between Hibbens’ Ferry and Santee would land and take the Upper
Guard-House</i>. I then said, then this thing seems true. My man,
said he, God has a hand in it, <i>we have been meeting for four years,
and are not yet betrayed</i>. I told him, I was afraid, after all, of the
white people from the back country and Virginia, &amp;c. He said that
the blacks would collect so numerous from the country, we need not
fear the whites from the other parts, for when we have once got the
city we can keep them all out. He asked, if I had told my boys.
I said no. Then said he, you should do it, for Ned Bennett has his
people pretty well ranged. But, said he, take care and don’t mention
it to those waiting men who receive <i>presents of old coats, &amp;c. from
their masters, or they’ll betray us</i>. I will speak to them. We
then parted, and I have not since conversed with him. He said the
rising was to take place last Sunday night, (16th June)—That <i>any of
the coloured people who said a word about this matter would be killed
by the others. The little man, who can’t be killed, shot or taken</i> is
named Jack, a Gullah Negro. Peter said there was a French Company
in town of three hundred men fully armed—that he was to see
Monday Gell, about expediting the rising. I know that Mingo went
often to Mr. Paul’s to see Edwin, but don’t know if he spoke with
William. Peter said he had a sword, and I ought to get one. He
said he had got a letter from the country; I think from St. Thomas’,
from a negro man who belonged to the captain of a militia company,
who said he could easily get the key of the house where the company’s
arms were put after muster, and take them all out, and help in that
way. This business originates altogether with the <i>African Congregation</i>,
in which Peter is a leader. When Bennett’s Ned asked about
those taken up, he alluded particularly to Mr. Paul’s William, and
asked me if I said any thing to him about it.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'><i>The voluntary confession of <span class='sc'>Rolla</span>, to the Court, made after his trial, but before sentence was passed on him.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I know Denmark Vesey, on one occasion, he asked me what news?
I told him, none. He replied, we are free, but the white people here
won’t let us be so; and the only way is, to raise up and fight the
whites. I went to his house one night, to learn where the meetings
were held. I never conversed on this subject with Batteau or Ned.—Vesey
told me, he was the leader in this plot. I never conversed either
with Peter or Mingo. Vesey induced me to join. When I went
to Vesey’s house, there was a meeting there, the room was full of people,
but none of them white. That night, at Vesey’s, we determined
to have arms made, and each man to put in twelve and a half cents
towards that purpose. Though Vesey’s room was full, I did not
know one individual there. At this meeting, Vesey said, we were to
take the Guard-House and Magazines, to get arms; that we ought to
rise up against the whites to get our liberties. He was the first to rise
up and speak, and he read to us from the Bible, how the <i>children of
Israel were delivered out of Egypt from bondage</i>; he said, that
the rising would take place last Sunday night week, (the 16th June)
and that Peter Poyas was one.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Examination of <span class='sc'>Sally</span>, a negro woman belonging to Mr. Alexander Howard.</i></h4>

<p class='c014'>I know Jesse, and heard him speak several times about it; one
day in particular, he was anxious to see his brother, who has my mother
for his wife, and waited until he came, when they conversed together.
Jesse said, he had got a horse to go into the country, to bring
down men to fight the white people; that he was allowed to pass by
two parties of the patrol on the road, but that a third party had
brought him back, and that, if there were but five men like him, they
would destroy the city. This was on last Sunday week, (the 16th
June,) he said, that before 3 o’clock, that night, all the white people
would be killed. That, if any person informed, or would not join in
the fight, such person would be killed or poisoned. He frequently
came into the yard to see his brother, and I threatened to inform, if he
came there, and spoke in that way, to get us all into trouble. We
never had any quarrel.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Examination of <span class='sc'>Lot</span>, a negro man belonging to Mr. Forrester</i>.</h4>

<p class='c014'>I know Jesse; he met me last Sunday week (16th June) at the
corner of Boundary street, as I was coming into town; he said, he
was going to get a horse to go into the country. From what my master
had told me the Thursday before, I distrusted his errand, and gave
him a caution. When, as I was going down into town towards Mr.
Hibbens’ ferry slip, and conversing with him, he said, you shall see to
night, when I come down, what I am going up for, and, <i>if my own
father does not assist, I will cut off his head</i>. He said, he was going
as far as Goose Creek bridge, and would get a horse if it cost him nine
dollars. The church bells were then ringing, and at half past eleven
o’clock, same day, I saw him at Mr. Howard’s, and afterwards understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>from Sally, that he had set off for the country, and had been
brought back by the Patrol.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Examination of <span class='sc'>Frank</span>, a negro man belonging to Mrs. Ferguson</i>.</h4>

<p class='c014'>I know Denmark Vesey, and have been to his house; I have heard
him say, that the negroe’s situation was so bad, he did not know how
they could endure it; and was astonished they did not rise and fight
for themselves, and he advised me to join, and rise. He said, he was
going about to see different people, and mentioned the names of Ned,
Bennett and Peter Poyas, as concerned with him; that he had spoken
to Ned and Peter on this subject, and that they were to go about and tell
the blacks, that they were free, and must rise and fight for themselves:
that they would take the Magazines and Guard Houses, and the City,
and be free; that he was going to send into the country to inform the
people there, too; he said, he wanted me to join them. I said, I could
not answer. He said, if I would not go into the country for him, he
could get others; he said, himself, Ned Bennett, Peter Poyas and
Monday Gell, were the principal men, and himself the head man.—He
said, they were the principal men to go about and inform the people,
and fix them, &amp;c.; that one party would land on <i>South Bay</i>, one
about Wappoo and about the Farms; that the party which was to
land on South Bay, was to take the <i>Guard-House, and get arms, and
then they would be able to go on</i>; that the attack was to commence
about 12 o’clock at night; that great numbers would come from all
about, and it must succeed, as so many were engaged in it; that they
would kill all the whites; that they would leave their masters’ houses,
and assemble near the Lines, march down and meet the party which
would land on South Bay; that he was going to send a man into the
country on a horse, to bring down the country people, and that he
would pay for the horse. He gave two dollars to Jesse, to get the
horse on Saturday week last, (15th June) about 1 o’clock in the day,
and myself and witness (No. 8,) also put in 25 cents a piece, and he
told Jesse, if he could not go, he must send some one else. I have seen
Ned Bennett at Vesey’s. I one night met at Vesey’s a great number
of men, and as they came in, they each handed him some money.—Vesey
said, there was a <i>little man, named Jack</i>, who could not be
killed, and who would furnish them with arms; he had a charm, and
would lead them; that Charles Drayton had promised to be engaged
with them. Vesey said, the negroes were living such an abominable
life, they ought to rise. I said, I was living well. He said, though I
was, others was not, and that it was such fools as I, that were in their
way, and would not help them, and that, after all things were well, he
would mark me. He said, he did not go with <i>Creighton to Africa,
because he had not a will, he wanted to stay and see what he could
do for his fellow creatures</i>. I met Ned, Monday, and others, at Denmark
Vesey’s, where they were talking about this business.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first time I spoke with Monday Gell, it was one night at Denmark
Vesey’s house, where I heard Vesey tell Monday, that he must
send some one into the country to bring the people down. Monday
said, he had sent up Jack, and told him to tell the people to come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>down and join in the fight against the whites; and also to ascertain
and inform him how many people he could get. A few days after, I
met Vesey, Monday and Jack in the streets, under Mr. Duncan’s
trees, at night, where Jack stated, he had been into the country, round
by Goose Creek and Dorchester; that he had spoken to 6,600 persons,
who had agreed to join. Monday said to Vesey, that it Jack
had so many men, they had better wait no longer, but begin the business
at once, and others would join. The first time I saw Monday at
Vesey’s, he was going away early, when Vesey asked him to stay, to
which Monday replied, he expected that night a meeting at his house,
to fix upon and mature the plan, &amp;c. and that he could stay no longer.
I afterwards conversed with Monday in his shop, when he asked me,
if I had heard that Bennett’s and Poyas’ people were taken up, that
it was a great pity. He said, he had joined in the business. I told
him to take care he was not taken up. Whenever I talked with Vesey,
he always spoke of Monday Gell as being his principal and active
man in this business.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Examination of Witness No. 10, a Negro Man.</i></h4>

<p class='c014'>Peter Poyas was the first man who spoke to me, and asked me to
join. I asked him what, the church? He said no, have you not heard,
that the blacks were joining, to try and take the country. I asked
him, if he thought he had men enough to do it? He said yes, a plenty
of men, and the Society will contribute money, with which a white
man would purchase guns and powder for them. He said he would
call back, and I must consider if I would join them. He called back,
and asked me, if I was willing now? Why Peter, said I, you have not
got force enough. He said, if I did not join, he would turn all my
country people against me. Said I, if so, I’ll join you, but you must
not put my name down, when you come out, if I find you strong
enough, I’ll join you. Well, said he, if you don’t join you’ll be killed.
Peter and Harry Haig called on me afterwards, I was not at
home; but the next morning I met Harry, who asked me for my
name. I refused it. He said, I would be killed if I did not join. I
said, I would join when they came out, if they were stronger than the
whites. Harry called on me again, and asked me, if I was willing
that the thing would break out soon. I asked him, where they would
begin? He said, in Boundary street. At what hour? He said, at 12
o’clock at night, or early in the morning, as soon as the guard is discharged.
Jack Pritchard called on me, he is sometimes called Gullah
Jack, sometimes Couter Jack, he gave me some dry food, consisting
of parched corn and ground nuts, and said, eat that, and nothing else,
on the morning when it breaks out, and when you join us as we pass,
put into your mouth this crab claw, and you can’t be wounded, and,
said he, I give the same to the rest of my troops—if you drop the large
crab claw out of your mouth, then put in the small one. Said I, when
do you break out, and have you arms. He said, plenty, but they are
over Boundary street, we can’t get at them now, but as soon as the patrol
was slack, they could get them; this was previous to the 16th
June, on which day, he said, they were to break out. On that day he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>came to me, and said, they could not break out that night, as the patrol
was too strong; he said, he would let me know when they were
ready. That Sunday fortnight, the 30th June, he came to me and
said, I must lay by still, they would not break out then, that he had
been round to all his company and found them cowards. I said, thank
God, then! He said, give me back my corn and cullah, (that is crab
claw). I said, I would not, and upbraided him for having deluded so
many. He said, all his country born promised him to join, because
he was a Doctor, (that is a Conjurer). He said, the white people was
looking for him, and he was afraid of being taken, that two men came
to his master’s wharf, and asked him, if he knew Gullah Jack, and
that he told them, no. He said, his charms would not protect him from
the treachery of his own colour. He went away, and I have not seen
him since. Harry Haig has since seen me several times, and told me
to hold myself ready. I said, I’m ready when called on. He said,
all the draymen came to his master’s cooper yard, and said they were
ready, but he told them, he was only waiting for Gullah Jack. He
said, he would tell me when they were ready, that they were only
waiting for the head man, who was a white man; but he, although
asked, would neither tell me the white man’s name, nor where the
powder and arms were; this was last Tuesday, the very day the six
negroes were hanged, about six o’clock, A. M. this was the last time
we spoke, though I have seen him since. I saw Charles Drayton before
the 16th, at Monday Gell’s, I was going to market, and Charles
called to me as I crossed the street; Joe, who has a wife at Mr. Remoussin’s,
asked me, if I did know that Monday was at the head of
the Ebo Company, who are going to fight the white people; Monday
is an Ebo. I asked Joe, if he was one of that company. He said
yes, he was. I asked him, what he could do, as he was an invalid.—He
said, he would take Remoussin’s sword and gun, and tell him to
lay down in his bed and be quiet. We parted. Previous to the 16th
of June, Monday Gell called me into his shop; I went in, and said
to him, I heard he was captain of his countrymen’s company, the
Ebo’s. He said, he was a sort of a one. I bid him good morning,
when he said, when you want to hear the news, come here. I never
saw him afterwards.</p>

<p class='c005'>I met Charles Drayton on the 1st of July in the streets, when he
said, now get ready, we must break out at once, for we will not let
six lives be taken. I asked him, where they would begin? He said,
in Boundary street, directly as the patrol and light horse turned in.
I said, had you not better wait till after the 4th of July. He said, no,
because in the mean time the people would be hanged. Charles said,
they had force enough, and we parted. I met him in Market, betwixt
8 and 9 o’clock, on the 2d of July, and said to him, now the
people are hanged, I suppose you are sorry you joined in the business.
He said yes, and we parted. Peter Poyas told me also, that
they had force enough, that some would come from James’ and John’s
islands, and some from Christ’s Church Parish, where he generally
went over to a meeting to have a talk, and that he had some about and
in town, the number of which he would show me from the Society
books, if I would only come to the Society. He said, they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>to fight the whites, and keep on fighting, till the English came to help
them. Harry told me the same thing. Jack being the head man, I
asked him about the plan, he told me the same thing; that the English
were to come here to help them, that the Americans could do
nothing against the English, and that the English would carry them
off to St. Domingo. Monday and Charles were very great together.
John, Mr. Horry’s coachman, came to me one day, and asked me
what I thought? Every one is ready, said John, to fight the whites,
are you ready? He said, I am ready. This took place sometime before
the 16th June, and every day he asked me the same questions.—About
this time George Vanderhorst came to me and said, they were
going to take the country, and he had joined; that he was ready
whenever the blacks broke out. He requested me to let him sleep at
my wife’s house near Boundary street; I saw him almost every day
after the 16th June, and he always said, he was ready whenever the
troops were ready. On the 16th June, Jack requested me to let
twelve men sleep at my wife’s, as they were to break out that night,
and he wanted them to be near Boundary street. On being refused,
he departed in anger, and reproached me. George called on me yesterday
morning, and asked, if I knew that Charles Drayton was taken
up, and said, he was afraid Charles would name him, not because he
was on his list, for he had joined Jack’s company, but because Charles
had met him at Gullah Jack’s, when they were consulting on the subject;
that, if he could near that Charles had named him, he would
run off. On Monday, 1st July, Charles Drayton told me, that there
would be an insurrection on the morning of the 6th July, as soon as
the Guard turned in; he said, he commanded the country born company.
Jack told me on the 1st July the same thing, and in addition,
that they were to rush in with their dirks, guns and swords, &amp;c. they
had got, kill the City Guard, and take all the arms in the arsenals;
he also said, there were some arms in King street, beyond Boundary
street, in possession of a white man, which they intended to
take, (alluding to the arms of the Charleston Neck Company, deposited
at Wharton’s, in King street). Charles Drayton said, he
had prepared for himself a gun and a sword. John Horry came to me
very often, and once said, he had a sword, and that, as soon as it
broke out, he would go up stairs and kill his master and family. On
the 17th of June, on his carriage box, he expressed himself to me in
the same manner he had done previous to the 16th. The blacks
would have risen on the night of the 16th, had the Guards not been so
strong; this I know from Gullah Jack and Harry Haig, who said, that
if the Guards were not too strong, they would get the arms near the
Lines, but if the Guards were out, they could not get them to break
out with.</p>

<p class='c014'>Julius Forrest, and myself, always worked together. Gullah Jack
calls himself a negro doctor, he induced Julius and myself to join at
last, but at first we refused; before the 16th June, Jack appointed to
meet us at Bulkley’s Farm; when we got there, Jack was not there,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>but Peter Poyas came; we broke up at day-light. Not quite a month
before the 16th June, Jack met me, and talked about war. I asked
Jack, how he would do for arms? Bye and bye, said Jack, we will
have arms; he said, he would have some arms made at the blacksmiths.
Jack was going to give * * * * *

was taken up and condemned to death, I was just like I was bound
up, and had not the power to speak one word about it. Jack charmed
Julius and myself at last, and we then consented to join. Tom
Russell, the blacksmith and Jack are partners, (in conjuring) Jack
learnt him to be a doctor. Tom talked to Jack about the fighting,
and agreed to join, and those two brought Julius and myself to agree
to it. Jack said, Tom was his second, and “when you don’t see me,
and see Tom, you see one.” Jack said, Tom was making arms for
the black people; Jack said, he would not be killed, nor could a white
man take him.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Confession of <span class='sc'>Jesse</span>, the slave of Thomas Blackwood, Esqr.; furnished to the Court by the Rev. Dr. <span class='sc'>D. Hall</span>.</i></h4>

<p class='c014'>I was invited to Denmark Vesey’s house, and when I went, I found
several men met together, among whom was Ned Bennett, Peter Poyas,
and others, whom I did not know. Denmark opened the meeting
by saying, he had an important secret to communicate to us, which
we must not disclose to any one, and if we did, we should be put to
instant death. He said, we were deprived of our rights and privileges
by the white people, and that our church was shut up, so that we
could not use it, and that it was high time for us to seek for our rights,
and that we were fully able to conquer the whites, if we were only unanimous
and courageous, as the St. Domingo people were. He then
proceeded to explain his plan, by saying, that they intended to make
the attack by setting the governor’s mills on fire, and also some houses
near the water, and as soon as the bells began to ring for fire, that they
should kill every man, as he came out of his door, and that the servants
in the yards should do it, and that it should be done with axes
and clubs, and afterwards they should murder the women and children,
for he said, God had so commanded it in the Scriptures. At another
meeting at Denmark’s, Ned Bennett and Peter Poyas, and several
others were present in conversation, some said, they thought it was
cruel to kill the ministers, and the women and children, but Denmark
Vesey said, he thought it was for our safety, not to spare one white
skin alive, for this was the plan they pursued in St. Domingo. He
then said to me, Jesse, I want you to go into the country, to enlist as
many of the country negroes as possible, to be in readiness to come
down to assist us. I told him, I had no horse, and no money to hire
one; he then took out two dollars, and gave them to me to hire a
horse, and told me to enlist as many as possible. I got the horse the
next Sabbath, and started, but the guard was so strict, I could not pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>them without being taken up; so I returned, and told Denmark, at
which he expressed his sorrow, and said, the business was urgent, for
they wanted the country people to be armed, that they might attack
the Forts at the same time, and also to take every ship and vessel in
the harbor, and to put every man to death, except the captains. For,
said he, it will not be safe to stay in Charleston, for as soon as they had
got all the money out of the banks, and the goods out of the stores on
board, they intended to sail for St. Domingo; for he had a promise,
that they would receive and protect them. This Jesse asserted to me,
was the truth, whilst the tears were running down his cheeks,
and he appeared truly penitent; and I have reason to hope,
that he obtained pardon from God, through the merits of Christ, and
was prepared to meet his fate with confidence, and that he was accepted
of God. At 4 o’clock on the morning of the execution, I visited
all the prisoners condemned, and found Jesse at prayers. He
told me, his mind was placid and calm; he then assured me, that
what he had told me was the truth, and <i>that he was prepared to meet
his God</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Confession of <span class='sc'>Monday Gell</span>.</i></h4>

<p class='c014'>I come out as a man who knows he is about to die—some time after Christmas
Vesey passed my door, he called in and said to me, that he was trying to gather
the blacks to try and see if any thing could be done to overcome the whites;
he asked me to join; I asked him his plan and his numbers; he said he had
Peter Poyas, Ned Bennett, and Jack Purcell; he asked me to join; I said no;
he left me and I saw him not for some time. About four or five weeks ago as
I went up Wentworth street, Frank Ferguson met me, and said he had four
plantation’s of people who he was to go for on Saturday, 15th June. How, said
I, will you bring them down; he said through the woods; he asked me if I was
going towards Vesey’s to ask Vesey to be at home that evening, and he would
be there to tell him his success. I asked Jack Purcell to carry this message, he
said he would; that same evening at my house I met Vesey’s mulatto boy, he
told me Vesey wished to see me, I went with him; when I went into Vesey’s I
met Ned Bennett, Peter Poyas, and Frank Ferguson, and Adam, and Gullah
Jack; they were consulting about the plan; Frank told Vesey on Saturday,
15th, he would go and bring down the people and lodge them near town in
the woods; the plan was to arm themselves by breaking open the stores with
arms. I then told Vesey I would join them, after sometime I told them I had
some business of my own and asked them to excuse me, I went away, and only
then was I ever there. One evening, Perault Strohecker, and Bacchus Hammett
brought to my shop a keg, and asked me to let it stay there till they sent for it;
I said yes, but did not know the contents; the next evening Gullah Jack came
and took away the keg, this was before the 16th June; since I have been in
prison I learnt that the keg contained powder.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pharo Thompson is concerned, and he told me, a day or two after Ned and
Peter were taken up, if he could get a fifty dollar bill, he would run away; about
two Sundays before I was brought here, he asked me, in Archdale-Street, when
shall we be like those white people in the church; I said when it pleased God;
Sunday before I was taken up, he met me as I came out of Archdale Church,
and took me into a stable in said street, and told me he told his master, who had
asked him, that he had nothing to do in this affair; which was a lie. William
Colcock came to my shop once and said a brother told him that five hundred
men were making up for the same purpose. Frank said he was to send to HellHole
Swamp to get men.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perault Strohecker is engaged; he used to go of a Sunday on horse back up
the road to a man he knows on the same errand. One Sunday he asked me to
go with him; I went and Smart Anderson; we went to a small house a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>way from the road after you turn into the ship yard road, on its left hand; they
too went into the stable with an old man that lived there, I remained in the
yard; they remained in the stable about half an hour; as soon as they came out,
I and Perault started to town to go to church, and left Smart there; I was
told by Denbow Martin, who has a wife in Mr. Smith’s house, that Stephen
Smith belonged to some of the gangs.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saby Gaillard is concerned; he met me on the Bay, before the 16th of June and
gave me a piece of paper from his pocket; this paper was about the battle that
Boyer had in St. Domingo; in a day or two he called on me and asked if I had
read it, and said if he had as many men he would do the same too, as he could
whip ten white men himself; he frequently came to me to speak about this matter,
and at last I had to insult him out of the shop; he and Paris Ball was often
together. A week before I was taken up, Paris told me that my name was
called.</p>

<p class='c005'>Billy Palmer and Vesey were constantly together; there was once in my shop
a long talk between them about this same matter; I begged them to stop it;
Vesey told him to try to get as many as he could; he said he would.</p>

<p class='c005'>John Vincent told me that Edward Johnson, a free man, had said, as he was
a free man he would have nothing to do with slaves, but the night they began
he would join them.</p>

<p class='c005'>I told Charles Drayton what uproar there was about this business, and since
we have been here we have talked together.</p>

<p class='c005'>Albert Inglis came to me and asked if I knew any thing about it; I said yes.
He asked me if I had joined; I said yes; he said he was one also; he said
Adam, a free man wanted to see me, I went with him one night; Adam asked
me how many men had joined; I told him what Frank Ferguson had said; he
asked me if I believed it; I said yes; he said if he could only find men behind
him he would go before. Previous to the 16th, Albert said to me quit the
business; I told him I was too far into it, so I must stick to it.</p>

<p class='c005'>I never wrote to St. Domingo<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c008'><sup>[16]</sup></a> or any where else on this subject, nor kept a
list or books, nor saw any such things, but heard that Paul’s William had a list,
nor did I hear any thing about arms being in possession of the blacks. I don’t
know that Tom Russel made pikes, nor that Gullah Jack had any of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lewis Remoussin called at my shop and asked me to call at his house, he
had something to tell me, but I did not go; Jack Glen told me he was
engaged.</p>

<p class='c005'>I met Scipio Sims one Sunday, coming from the country, who said he
had been near the Savannah’s to Mr. Middleton’s place; I heard afterwards
that his errand was on this business.</p>

<p class='c005'>I know John the cooper, who said he was engaged too in this business.</p>

<p class='c005'>William Garner said he was engaged in it and had got twelve or thirteen
draymen to join.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sandy Vesey told me he belonged to it too.</p>

<p class='c005'>At Vesey’s house, Frank told Gullah Jack, to put one ball and three buck
shot in each cartridge.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mingo Harth acknowledged to me that he had joined, and Peter Poyas told
me so too; he, Mingo, told me so several times; Mingo said he was to have his
master’s horse on the night of the 16th.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lot Forrester told me frequently that he was one of the company, and I

that he had joined, he knew I was in the business.</p>

<p class='c005'>Morris Brown knew nothing of it, and we agreed not to let him, Harry
Drayton, or Charles Corr, know anything about it. —— —— told me in my
store that he was to get some powder from his master and give it to Peter
Poyas; he seemed to have been a long time engaged in it, and to know a
great deal. Joe Jore acknowledged to me once or twice that he had joined,
he said he knew some of the Frenchmen concerned; he knew I was in it.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>The Confession of <span class='sc'>Jack Purcell</span>.</i></h4>

<p class='c014'>If it had not been for the cunning of that old villain Vesey, I should not
now be in my present situation. He employed every stratagem to induce me
to join him. He was in the habit of reading to me all the passages in the
newspapers that related to St. Domingo, and apparently every pamphlet he could
lay his hands on, that had any connection with slavery. He one day brought
me a speech which he told me had been delivered in Congress by a <i>Mr. King</i>
on the subject of slavery; he told me this Mr. King was the black man’s friend,
that he Mr. King had declared he would continue to speak, write and publish
pamphlets against slavery the longest day he lived, until the Southern States
consented to emancipate their slaves, for that slavery was a great disgrace
to the country.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CONFESSION OF JOHN ENSLOW.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Monday Gell led me in it and took me to Vesey’s; there was a large meeting;
Vesey told the meeting the people was to rise up and fight the white people
for their liberty; we always went to Monday’s house afterwards; Monday did
all the writing; I heard they were trying all round the country to Georgetown,
Santee, and round to Combahee, &amp;c. about to get people; Peter was
also there, he was one; Peter named Poyas’ plantation, where he went to
meet; Bellisle Yates I have seen at the meetings, and Adam Yates, Naphur Yates,
Dean Mitchell, Cæsar Smith and George (a Stevedore.) At Vesey’s they wanted
to make a collection to make pikes for the country people, but the men had
no money! Monday Gell said Purcell was one to get horses to send men into
the country; I heard a blacksmith was to make pikes. Jack M’Neil is engaged;
I have seen them all at Monday’s; Jack said he was one and would try to get
men; the plan was to take the Arsenals and Guard Houses for arms, and not
to fire the town unless they failed; Monday was writing a letter to St. Domingo,
to go by a vessel lying at Gibb’s and Harper’s wharf; the letter was about the
sufferings of the blacks, and to know if the people of St. Domingo would help
them if they made an effort to free themselves; he was writing this letter in
March, I am not certain of the time; Perault was present when Monday wrote
the letter, and also a painter, named Prince Righton; I have seen Pompey
Haig at Monday’s, but he neither assented or dissented; Jerry Cohen was at
Vesey’s, and said to me he was one; I heard from Vesey and Monday that they
had engaged men from the country; Peter Poyas said he had sent into the
country to his brother to engage men, who would send him an answer; a
party was to attack the Guard-House and Arsenal; another the Arsenal on
the Neck; another the Naval Stores on Mey’s wharf; another to attack the
Magazine; another to meet at Lightwood’s Alley and then try to cut off the
companies from meeting at their places of rendezvous; I belong to the African
Congregation; on Saturday the 15th June, a man was to be sent into the
country to bring down the people, and Rolla was to command the country
people from Ashley River at the Bridge; Ned Bennett and John Horry to
meet at Mr. Horry’s corner, and Batteau to come down with Vesey’s party.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>SENTENCE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'><i>9th July, 1822.</i>—<i><span class='sc'>Jack</span>, a slave, belonging to Paul Pritchard, commonly called
<span class='sc'>Gullah Jack</span>, and sometimes <span class='sc'>Couter Jack</span>, was brought up, and, sentence pronounced
by</i> L. H. KENNEDY, <i>Presiding Magistrate</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>JACK PRITCHARD—The Court, after deliberately considering all the circumstances
of your case, are perfectly satisfied of your guilt. In the prosecution
of your wicked designs, you were not satisfied with resorting to natural and ordinary
means, but endeavored to enlist on your behalf, all the powers of darkness,
and employed for that purpose, the most disgusting mummery and superstition.
You represented yourself as invulnerable; that you could neither be
taken nor destroyed, and that all who fought under your banners would be invincible.
While such wretched expedients are calculated to <i>inspire</i> the confidence,
or to alarm the fears of the ignorant and credulous, they excite no other
emotion in the mind of the intelligent and enlightened, but contempt and disgust.
Your boasted Charms have not preserved yourself, and of course could
not protect others. “Your Altars and your Gods have sunk together in the dust.”
The airy spectres, conjured by you, have been chased away by the superior light
of Truth, and you stand exposed, the miserable and deluded victim of offended
Justice. Your days are literally numbered. You will shortly be consigned
to the cold and silent grave, and all the Powers of Darkness cannot rescue
you from your approaching Fate! Let me then, conjure you to devote the
remnant of your miserable existence in fleeing from the “<i>wrath to come</i>.” This
can only be done by a full disclosure of the truth. The Court are willing to
afford you all the aid in their power, and to permit any Minister of the Gospel,
whom you may select to have free access to you. To him you may unburthen
your guilty conscience. Neglect not the opportunity, for there is “no
device nor art beyond the tomb,” to which you must shortly be consigned.</p>

<p class='c016'>SENTENCE <i>pronounced on <span class='sc'>Dick</span>, <span class='sc'>Bacchus</span>, <span class='sc'>William</span>, <span class='sc'>Naphur</span>, <span class='sc'>Adam</span>,
<span class='sc'>Bellisle</span>, <span class='sc'>Charles</span>, <span class='sc'>Jeremy</span> and <span class='sc'>Dean</span>, by L. H. <span class='sc'>Kennedy</span>, Esq. <span class='sc'>Presiding
Magistrate</span>.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>The Court, on mature deliberation, have pronounced you guilty; the punishment
of that guilt is <span class='fss'>DEATH</span>. Your conduct, on the present occasion, exhibits
a degree of depravity and extravagance, rarely paralleled. Your professed
objects were to trample, not only on the laws of this state, but on those of
humanity; to commit murder, outrage and plunder, and to substitute for the
blessings we enjoy, anarchy and confusion in their most odious forms.—The
beauties of nature and of art, would have fallen victims to your relentless fury;
and even the decrepitude of age and the innocence of childhood would have
found no other refuge than the grave!</p>

<p class='c005'>Surely, nothing but infatuation could have prompted you to enter into a plot
so wild and diabolical. A moment’s reflection would have convinced you, that
disgrace and ruin must have been its consequence, and that it would have probably
resulted in the destruction and extermination of <i>your race</i>. But if, even
complete success had crowned your efforts, what were the golden visions which
you anticipated? Such men as you, are, in general, as ignorant as you are
vicious, without any settled principles, and possessing but few of the virtues of
civilized life;—you would soon, therefore, have degenerated into a horde of
barbarians, incapable of any government. But, admitting that a different result
might have taken place, it is natural to inquire, what are the miseries of which
you complain? That we should all earn our bread by the sweat of our brow,
is the decree which God pronounced at the fall of man. It extended alike to
the master and the slave; to the cottage and the throne. Every one is more or
less subject to control; and the most exalted, as well as the humblest individual,
must bow with deference to the laws of that community, in which he is
placed by Providence. Your situation, therefore, was neither extraordinary
nor unnatural. Servitude has existed under various forms, from the Deluge to
the present time, and in no age or country has the condition of slaves been
milder or more humane, than your own. You are, with few exceptions, treated
with kindness, and enjoy every comfort compatible with your situation. You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>are exempt from many of the miseries, to which <i>the poor</i> are subject throughout
the world. In many countries the life of the slave is at the disposal of his
master; here you have always been under the protection of the law.</p>

<p class='c005'>The tribunal which now imposes this sentence, through its humble organ,
affords a strong exemplification of the truth of these remarks. In the discharge
of the painful duties which have devolved on them, the members of
this Court have been as anxious to acquit the innocent as determined to condemn
the guilty.</p>

<p class='c005'>In addition to the crime of treason, you have on the present occasion, displayed
the vilest ingratitude. It is a melancholy truth that those servants in
whom was reposed the most unlimited confidence, have been the principal
actors in this wicked scheme. Reared by the hand of kindness, and fostered by
a master who assumed many of the duties of a parent, you have realized the
fable of the Frozen Serpent, and attempted to destroy the bosom that sheltered
and protected you.</p>

<p class='c005'>You have, moreover, committed the grossest impiety: you have perverted
the sacred words of God, and attempted to torture them into a sanction for
crimes, at the bare imagination of which, humanity shudders. Are you incapable
of the Heavenly influence of that Gospel, all whose “paths are Peace?”
It was to reconcile us to our destiny on earth, and to enable us to discharge with
fidelity all our duties, whether as master or servant, that those inspired precepts
were imparted by Heaven to fallen man. There is no condition of life which is
not embraced by them: and if you had searched them, <i>in the spirit of truth</i>, you
would have discovered instructions peculiarly applicable to yourselves—“<i>Servants</i>
(says St. Paul) <i>be obedient to them that are your masters, according to the
flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ: not with
eye-service as men pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God
from the heart.</i>” Had you listened with sincerity to such doctrines, you would
not have been arrested by an ignominious death.</p>

<p class='c005'>Your days on earth are near their close and you now stand upon the confines
of eternity. While you linger on this side of the grave, permit me to exhort
you, in the name of the ever-living God, whose holy ordinances you have
violated, to devote most earnestly the remnant of your days, in penitence and
preparation for that Tribunal, whose sentence, whether pronounced in anger
or in mercy, is eternal.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>The above Sentences is selected out of the many passed on this occasion, with a
view, to give the reader a general idea of them.</i></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>POSTSCRIPT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Since these sheets have been put to press, it affords him, who has
been engaged in their preparation, much gratification to be able to correct
one mistake, as it places the fidelity of the slave who first gave
the intelligence of the intended insurrection, on much higher ground.
On conferring with his master and the free man of colour, whose advice
he sought, it appears that the slave in question communicated the conversation
at the Market to his young master, before he consulted his
friend, (the free man of colour,) and that the advice of the latter was
that as “his young master was a youth, that it would be best for him
<i>immediately, without delay</i>, to tell his mistress, that his master
might receive the information the instant he came to town.” <i>Vide</i>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. After the execution of Peter, his guilt, in the most flagrant degree
became most abundantly established; affording, in every particular,
the strongest corroboration of the testimony by which he had
been convicted. It was apparent that he was the most efficient of all
the ringleaders, and one who possessed the largest share of the confidence
of Denmark Vesey, who was, in every sense of the term, the
father of the plot. Peter was a slave of great value, and for his colour,
a first rate ship-carpenter. He had the confidence of his master in a
remarkable degree, and had been treated with indulgence, liberality
and kindness.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. As Denmark Vesey has occupied so large a place in the conspiracy,
a brief notice of him will, perhaps, be not devoid of interest.
The following anecdote will show how near he was to the chance of
being distinguished in the bloody events of San Domingo. During
the revolutionary war, Captain Vesey, now an old resident of this
city, commanded a ship that traded between St. Thomas’ and Cape
Francais (San Domingo.) He was engaged in supplying the French
of that Island with Slaves. In the year 1781, he took on board at
St. Thomas’ 390 slaves and sailed for the Cape; on the passage, he
and his officers were struck with the beauty, alertness and intelligence
of a boy about 14 years of age, whom they made a pet of, by taking
him into the cabin, changing his apparel, and calling him by way of
distinction <i>Telemaque</i>, (which appellation has since, by gradual corruption,
among the negroes, been changed to <i>Denmark</i>, or sometimes
<i>Telmak</i>.) On the arrival, however, of the ship at the Cape, Captain
Vesey, having no use for the boy, sold him among his other slaves,
and returned to St. Thomas’. On his next voyage to the Cape, he
was surprised to learn from his consignee that Telemaque would be
returned on his hands, as the planter, who had purchased him, represented
him unsound, and subject to epileptic fits. According to the
custom of trade in that place, the boy was placed in the hands of the
king’s physician, who decided that he was unsound, and Captain
Vesey was compelled to take him back, of which he had no occasion
to repent, as Denmark proved, for 20 years, a most faithful slave.
In 1800, Denmark drew a prize of $1500 in the East-Bay-Street
Lottery, with which he purchased his freedom from his master, at six
hundred dollars, much less than his real value. From that period to
the day of his apprehension he has been working as a carpenter in this
city, distinguished for great strength and activity. Among his colour
he was always looked up to with awe and respect. His temper was
impetuous and domineering in the extreme, qualifying him for the
despotic rule, of which he was ambitious. All his passions were
ungovernable and savage; and, to his numerous wives and children, he
displayed the haughty and capricious cruelty of an Eastern Bashaw.
He had nearly effected his escape, after information had been lodged
against him. For three days the town was searched for him without
success. As early as Monday, the 17th, he had concealed himself. It
was not until the night of the 22d of June, during a perfect tempest, that
he was found secreted in the house of one of his wives. It is to the
uncommon efforts and vigilance of Mr. Wesner, and Capt. Dove, of
the City Guard, (the latter of whom seized him) that public justice
received its necessary tribute, in the execution of this man. If the
party had been one moment later, he would, in all probability, have
effected his escape the next day in some outward bound vessel.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. <i>Monday Gell</i> is very well known in this city. He is a most excellent
harness-maker, and kept his shop in Meeting-Street. It
would be difficult to name any individual more actively engaged in
the plot than himself, or more able to aid Denmark Vesey, from his
uncommon sagacity and knowledge. He reads and writes with great
and equal facility, and obviously seems to have been the individual
who held the pen, at all the meetings. At which he wrote more than
<i>one</i> letter to San Domingo, for succors. His own situation afforded
no excuse for the effort in which he was engaged, as he enjoyed all
the substantial comforts of a free man; much indulged and trusted by
his master, his time and a large proportion of the profits of his labour
were at his own disposal. He even kept his master’s <i>arms</i> and sometimes
his money. Monday is an <i>Ebo</i>, and is now in the prime of
life, having been in the country 15 or 20 years.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. At the meeting of the Court on the morning of the 13th, Mr.
James Legare, from feeble health and great exhaustion during its
previous sittings, asked, and obtained leave, to withdraw, whereupon
Mr. Henry Deas, was summoned by the Magistrates, who took his
seat and served until the adjournment of the Court.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. This farm was under the charge of a slave named <i>Billy</i>, who

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. <i>Perault unhesitatingly stated to Monday’s face, that he had written two letters,
to St. Domingo, and that he (Perault) had gone to Vanderhorsts wharf with him, in
April or May last, to give them in charge of a black cook on board of a schooner
bound to that island. After Monday was so charged, he confessed that the fact was
so, and that he had been induced to conceal it under an apprehension that if it
were known he had been guilty of such an act all chance of mercy would be denied
him.</i></p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
